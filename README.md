Hi There!
This is my *unofficial* version of Sigma16.
I am focusing on improving the GUI, especially for the code editor. 

Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems at the University of GLasgow.
This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.
